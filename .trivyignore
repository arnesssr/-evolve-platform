# Trivy Security Scanner - Ignore File
# =====================================
# This file tells Trivy to ignore certain vulnerabilities that are not relevant to our Django application

# The kernel issues should be handled at the OS/infrastructure level, not application level

# Focus only on:
# - Python package vulnerabilities
# - Django security issues  
# - Application-level dependencies
# - Container/Docker related issues (if applicable)

# Note: This file helps focus security scanning on actual application risks
# rather than system-level kernel issues that should be handled by infrastructure teams
